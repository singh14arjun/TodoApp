Project Description: To-Do List Web Application
The To-Do List Web Application is a simple and efficient task management platform developed using Java and Spring Boot with a Thymeleaf frontend. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks while providing an intuitive and responsive interface for managing their daily activities.

Key Features:
Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by entering a title, description, and target date.
Task Viewing: All tasks are displayed in a list format, showing the task title, description, status (completed or pending), and target date.
Task Editing: Users can update task details such as the title, description, and status (marking tasks as completed).
Task Deletion: Tasks can be removed from the list when no longer needed.
Responsive Design: The user interface is mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility and usability on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
Technologies Used:
Backend:
Java
Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA (for task management)
Thymeleaf (for dynamic HTML rendering)
Frontend:
HTML5
CSS3 (for responsive design)
Thymeleaf templating engine (for dynamic form handling and task rendering)
Database:
H2 (for in-memory database support during development)
How It Works:
Upon accessing the application, users are welcomed with an interface displaying the list of existing tasks.
Users can add a new task via a form that takes in task details such as title, description, and target completion date.
The task list page provides options to edit or delete existing tasks.
When editing a task, users can update its details or mark it as completed by checking a checkbox.
Purpose:
The To-Do List Web Application serves as a basic yet effective tool for task management, designed to demonstrate the use of modern Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. The project emphasizes clean, maintainable code, user-friendly design, and efficient data handling with a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system.

This project is ideal for users seeking to organize their tasks and for developers looking to understand the integration of Spring Boot with Thymeleaf for dynamic web application.
